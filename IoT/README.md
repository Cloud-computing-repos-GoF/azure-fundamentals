# Internet of Things (IoT)

Connecting physical and digital worlds.   

Smart devices that collect data. Examples:  
- Environmental sensors  
- QR Code  
- OCR scanner   
- Geo-location and proximity sensors  
- Infrared sensors    
- Ultrasonic o sonic sensors   
- Motion and touch sensors    
- Accelometer or Tilt  Sensors   
- Smoke, gas and alcohol Sensors  
- Error Sensors
- Mechanical Sensors  
- Flow and Pressure Sensors  

Messaging to an API. The Message of the machine sends (IoT devices: collect and send)  can be receive, store, organize and display by using Azure.

Services:  
- Azure IoT Hub: two way communication (IoT device 2 cloud). Command and Control. Tracking events (creations, failures, connections)      
- Azure IoT Central: Add a Dashboard to IoT Hub. Could use device templates.   
- Azure Sphere: End 2 end highly secure IoT solution for customers (Secure channel):
    * Azure Sphere microcontroller unit.  
    * Customize linux operating systems that handles communication.  
    * Azure sphere security services.
